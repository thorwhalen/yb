"""Lay a cover image out on a 16:9 canvas, and derive a thumbnail from it.

Cover art is usually square (or, worse, portrait) while video platforms are
16:9. Letting the platform pillarbox the art leaves black bars; instead we fill
the frame with a blurred, darkened copy of the cover and place the sharp cover
centred on top. It reads as intentional, and it is the same treatment whether
the result becomes a still video, the ground truth for a Ken Burns pan, or the
upload thumbnail — one :class:`CoverLayout`, one filtergraph, three uses.

Every filter chain here is built as a *string* rather than executed, so the
same chains compose into the bigger filtergraph that :mod:`yb.render.video`
assembles for audio-reactive visuals.
